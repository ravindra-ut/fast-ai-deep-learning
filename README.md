## 0. Convlve=Correlate.ipynb
With diagonal kernel filter, we prove that convolution operation can be thought as correlation operation where kernel is rotated by 180 degree.

## 1. VGG net in keras
Shows how to implement VGG with configuration D, in keras. Also shows how to calculate the number of parameters learned in each layer.
